			<h1 id="savings">SAVINGS INFORMATION</h1>
				<ul id="savingslist">
					<li>
						<h4>Apparel Printing/laser</h4> 
						<p>Note that all colours requiring print are subject to a set 
								up to cover labour costs.  Each Set up is $30.00.  We recommend using as 
								few colours as possible to reduce these costs.   Repeat set ups are also required.  
								Our graphic artist can provide professional art utilizing cost effective art models to achieve 
								the best value.</p>
							<p>The print size does not affect pricing.  Colours and locations affect pricing.   We recommend 
							utilizing the space within 1 location( front or back) for as much information required on the 
							garment.</p>
							<p>Volumes directly affect the costs of printing.  We recommend ordering fewer times rather than numerous times with small volumes.  Holding an inventory if you can saves dollars.</p>
							<p>Logo consistency is also key to savings.  Any changes to a logo or copy forces the project to begin anew.  We recommend maintaining a consistent logo throughout the entire print process.  Professional art created with cost savings in mind can accomplish compatible art keeping costs low.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h4>Apparel  Embroidery</h4>
							<p>Size and numbers of locations matters with embroidery.  Embroidery is priced via the stitch count.   We recommend a consistent logo with all the required information to be embroidered within 1 location. </p>
							<p>Number of colours within the logo does not affect pricing.  If possible we recommend ordering fewer times and holding an inventory if needs are regular through the year.</p> 
							<p>Repeat set ups are not required. </p>
							<p>Embroidery digitizing is priced per thousand stitches at $8.90 / thousand stitches.   A standard left chest logo approx 3.5 inches by 3.5 inches is approx 7000 stitches. </p>  
							<p>The number of locations also dictate pricing.  Consider a separate logo in a new location as a separate project as the labour is the same to accomplish this.</p>
					</li>
				</ul>

			<h1>Hard Goods pad Printing</h1>
				<p>Pens, Flash drives, Drink wear etc. all requires set ups for the number of colours being printed.  In order to save dollars we recommend designing your logo with as few colours as needed. 
				The number of locations also dictate pricing.  Consider a separate logo in a new location as a separate project as the labour is the same to accomplish this.
